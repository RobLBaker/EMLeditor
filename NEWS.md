Updating to vO.1.0.0 "Electric Peak" is recommended to all users because to take full advantage of metadata/DataStore integration.

Major changes include:

2) Inclusion of set_publisher function to customize the publisher and agencyOriginated options for non-NPS users, for NPS partners and contractors.

Minor changes:

1) CUI can now be overwritten as well as written

2) write_readme dynamically populates publisher information

3) Renamed functions and parameters to conform to tidyverse style guides

4) Removed redundant functions (set_doi)

5) Added ability to set DRR title and DOI

6) write_readme now defaults to printing to the screen (but can still save to a .txt file)

7) Update documentation to reflect changes

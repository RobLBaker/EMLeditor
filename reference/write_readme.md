# Writes a README file

write_readme writes a readme file based on the current metadata

## Usage

``` r
write_readme(eml_object, outfile = "")
```

## Arguments

- eml_object:

  is an R object imported (typically from an EML-formatted .xml file)
  using EML::read_eml(, from="xml").

- outfile:

  is the name of the file you want to write, typically \*.txt.

## Value

a character string in readable format (saved to the given outfile)

## Details

write_readme writes a mock-up of the readme file that will eventually be
automatically generated by DataStore. This file is for error checking
purposes only. If something looks off, you can go back and fix your
metadata to correct it but you should not upload this readme file with
your data package.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
write_readme(eml_object, "TestReadMe.txt")
} # }
```

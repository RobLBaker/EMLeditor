\title{Adds CUI dissemination codes to metadata}
\usage{
set_cui_code(
  eml_object,
  cui_code = c("PUBLIC", "NOCON", "DL ONLY", "FEDCON", "FED ONLY"),
  force = FALSE,
  NPS = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{eml_object}{is an EML-formatted R object, either generated in R or imported (typically from an EML-formatted .xml file) using EML::read_eml(\if{html}{\out{<filename>}}, from="xml").}

\item{cui_code}{a string consisting of one of 7 potential CUI codes: PUBLIC, FED ONLY, FEDCON, DL ONLY, or NOCON}

\item{force}{logical. Defaults to false. If set to FALSE, a more interactive version of the function requesting user input and feedback. Setting force = TRUE facilitates scripting.}

\item{NPS}{Logical. Defaults to TRUE. \strong{Most NPS users should leave this as the default}. Only under specific circumstances should it be set to FALSE: if you are \strong{not} publishing with NPS, if you need to set the publisher location to some place other than the Fort Collins Office (e.g. you are NOT working on a data package) or your product is "for" the NPS but not "by" the NPS and you need to specify a different agency, set NPS = FALSE. When NPS=TRUE, the function will over-write existing publisher info and inject NPS as the publisher along the the Central Office in Fort Collins as the location. Additionally, it sets the "for or by NPS" field to TRUE and specifies the originating agency as NPS.}

an EML-formatted R object

\description{
\code{set_cui_code()} adds Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) dissemination codes to EML metadata. These codes determine who can or cannot have access to the data. Unless you have a specific mandate to restrict data, all data should be available to the public. if the CUI dissemination code is PUBLIC, the CUI marking should also be PUBLIC (\verb{see set_cui_marking()}) and the license should be set to public domain (or CC0; see \code{set_int_rights()}). If your data contains CUI and you need to set the CUI dissemination code to anything other than PUBLIC, please be prepared to provide a legal justification in the form of the appropriate CUI marking (see \code{set_cui_marking()}).
}
\details{
\code{set_cui_code()} adds a CUI dissemination code to the tag CUI under additionalMetadata/metadata. The available choices for CUI dissemination codes at NPS are (pay attention to the spaces!):

PUBLIC: The data contain no CUI, dissemination is not restricted.
FED ONLY: Contains CUI. Only federal employees should have access (similar to the "internal only" setting in DataStore)
FEDCON: Contains CUI Only federal employees and federal contractors should have access to the data (again, very similar to the DataStore "internal only" setting)
DL ONLY: Contains CUI. Should only be available to a named list of individuals. (where and how to supply that list TBD)
NOCON - Contains CUI. Federal, state, local, or tribal employees may have access, but contractors cannot.

For a more detailed explanation of the CUI dissemination codes, please see the national archives \href{https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/limited-dissemination}{CUI Registry: Limited Dissemination Controls} web page.

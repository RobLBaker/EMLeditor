\description{
\code{upload_data_package()} inspects a data package and, if a DOI is supplied in the metadata, uploads the data files and metadata to the appropriate reference on DataStore. This function requires that you are logged on to the VPN. \code{upload_data_package()} will only work if each individual file in the data package is less than 32Mb. Larger files still require manual upload via the DataStore web interface. \code{upload_data_package()} just uploads files. It does not extract EML metadata to populate the reference fields on DataStore and it does not activate the reference - the reference remains fully editable via the web interface. After using \code{upload_data_package()} you do not need to "save" the reference on DataStore; the files are automatically saved to the reference.
}
\details{
Currently, only .csv data files and EML metadata files are supported. All .csvs must end in ".csv". The single metadata file must end in "_metadata.xml". If you have includced a DOI in your metadata, using \code{upload_data_package()} is preferrable to using the web interface to manually upload files because it insures that your files are uploaded to the correct reference (i.e. the DOI in your metadata corresponds to the draft reference code on DataStore).

Once uploaded, you are advised to look at the 'Files and Links' tab on the DataStore web interface to make sure your files are there and you do not have any duplicates. You can delete files as necessary from the 'Files and Links' tab until the reference is activated.

This function is primarily intended for uploading files to the data package reference type on DataStore, but will upload .csvs and a single EML metadata file saved as *_metadata.xml file to any reference type, assuming the metadata has a DOI listed in the expected location and there is a corresponding draft reference on DataStore.

\usage{
set_language(eml_object, lang, NPS = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eml_object}{is an R object imported (typically from an EML-formatted .xml file) using EmL::read_eml(<filename>, from="xml").}

\item{lang}{is a string consisting of the language the data and metadata were constructed in, for example, "English", "Spanish", "Navajo". Capitalization does not matter, but spelling does! The input provided here will be converted to 3-digit ISO 639-2 codes.}

\item{NPS}{Logical. Checks EML for NPS publisher info and injects it if publisher is empty. If publisher already exists, does nothing. If you are not publishing with NPS, set to FALSE. If NPS=TRUE, the originatingAgency will be set to NPS and the field that maps to DataStore's "by or for NPS" will be set to TRUE.}

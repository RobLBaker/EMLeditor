\usage{
set_protocol(eml_object, protocol_id, dev = FALSE, force = FALSE, NPS = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eml_object}{is an EML-formatted R object, either generated in R or imported (typically from an EML-formatted .xml file) using EML::read_eml(\if{html}{\out{<filename>}}, from="xml").}

\item{protocol_id}{a string. The 7-digit number identifying the DataStore reference number for the Project that describes your inventory or monitoring project.}

\item{dev}{Logical. Defaults to FALSE, meaning all API calls will be to the production version of DataStore. To test the function, set dev = TRUE to use the development environment for DataStore.}

\item{force}{logical. Defaults to false. If set to FALSE, a more interactive version of the function requesting user input and feedback. Setting force = TRUE facilitates scripting.}

\item{NPS}{Logical. Defaults to TRUE. \strong{Most NPS users should leave this as the default}. Only under specific circumstances should it be set to FALSE: if you are \strong{not} publishing with NPS, if you need to set the publisher location to some place other than the Fort Collins Office (e.g. you are NOT working on a data package) or your product is "for" the NPS but not "by" the NPS and you need to specify a different agency, set NPS = FALSE. When NPS=TRUE, the function will over-write existing publisher info and inject NPS as the publisher along the the Central Office in Fort Collins as the location. Additionally, it sets the "for or by NPS" field to TRUE and specifies the originating agency as NPS.}

This function is currently under development. If you use it, it will break your EML.  You've been warned.

set_protocol adds a metadata link to the protocol under which the data being described were collected. It automatically inserts a link to the DataStore landing page for the protocol as well as the protocol title and creator.
}
\details{
Because protocols can be published to DataStore using a number of different reference types, set_protocol does not check to make sure you are actually supplying a the reference ID for a protocol (or the correct protocol).

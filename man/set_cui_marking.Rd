\title{The function sets the CUI marking for the data package}
\usage{
set_cui_marking(
  eml_object,
  cui_marking = c("PUBLIC", "SP-NPSR", "SP-HISTP", "SP-ARCHR"),
  force = FALSE,
  NPS = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{eml_object}{is an EML-formatted R object, either generated in R or imported (typically from an EML-formatted .xml file) using EML::read_eml(\if{html}{\out{<filename>}}, from="xml").}

\item{cui_marking}{String. One of four options, "PUBLIC", "SP-NPSR", "SP-HISTP" or "SP-ARCHR" are available.}

\item{force}{logical. Defaults to false. If set to FALSE, a more interactive version of the function requesting user input and feedback. Setting force = TRUE facilitates scripting.}

\item{NPS}{Logical. Defaults to TRUE. \strong{Most NPS users should leave this as the default}. Only under specific circumstances should it be set to FALSE: if you are \strong{not} publishing with NPS, if you need to set the publisher location to some place other than the Fort Collins Office (e.g. you are NOT working on a data package) or your product is "for" the NPS but not "by" the NPS and you need to specify a different agency, set NPS = FALSE. When NPS=TRUE, the function will over-write existing publisher info and inject NPS as the publisher along the the Central Office in Fort Collins as the location. Additionally, it sets the "for or by NPS" field to TRUE and specifies the originating agency as NPS.}

The Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) marking is different from the CUI dissemination code. The CUI dissemination code (set \code{set_cui_code()}) sets who can have access to the data package. The CUI marking set by \code{set_cui_marking()} specifies the reason (if any) that the data are being restricted.
If the CUI dissemination code is set to PUBLIC, the CUI marking must also be PUBLIC.
If the CUI dissemination code is set to anything other than PUBLIC, the CUI marking must be set to SP-NPSR, SP-HISTP or SP-ARCHR.

\details{
CUI markings are the legal justification for why data are being restricted from the public. If data contain no CUI, the CUI marking must be set to PUBLIC (and the CUI dissemination code must be set to PUBLIC and the license must be set to CC0 or Public Domain). If the data contain CUI (i.e. the CUI dissemination code is not PUBLIC), you must use the CUI marking to provide a legal justification for why the data are restricted. Only one CUI marking can be applied. At NPS, the following markings are available:

PUBLIC: The data contain no CUI, dissemination is not restricted.
SP-NPSR: "National Park System Resources" - This material contains information concerning the nature and specific location of a National Park System resource that is endangered, threatened, rare, or commercially valuable, of mineral or paleontological objects within System units, or of objects of cultural patrimony within System units.
SP-HISTP: "Historic Properties" - This material contains information related to the location, character, or ownership of historic property.
SP-ARCHR: "Archaeological Resources" - This material contains information related to information about the nature and location of any archaeological resource for which the excavation or removal requires a permit or other permission.
